## Status

Check out the [Latest Releases](https://github.com/DeamonHunter/AWBW-Replay-Player/releases/latest) for the lastest release of this replay player.

This project is still under active development, and some things are likely to change a lot.

The current version is stable and has many of the basic features. Unfinished aspects include, replay rewinding by turn, unit/tile information, active camera, and many other things.

Code quality of this repo is not great yet. The aim will be to improve code quality after making sure things work.
